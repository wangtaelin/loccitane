                <h3>Order acceptance and billing</h3>
                <p>Orders are subject to verification and acceptance before shipping. All billing information provided must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or 
                    inaccurate information constitutes a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in our cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order, L'Occitane 
                    reserves the right to request additional information from you to verify your identity and validate the billing information to process your order. 
                </p>
                <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason, including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or 
                    pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud prevention department.If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other applicable 
                    payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will contact 
                    you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. L'Occitane may request a pre-authorization for 
                    some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; However, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short 
                    period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have 
                    sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
                </p>
                <p>By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the item(s) of Merchandise. You will not be charged for most 
                    orders until the order has shipped, however, you will be charged at the time your order is placed for orders paid for with a gift or e-gift card (collectively, 
                    “Gift Card”), PayPal account , and Amazon Payment. Orders placed using PayPal, Amazon Payments, and e-gift card cannot be modified. However, if you need to 
                    modify an order that you paid for with funds through PayPal or Amazon Payments, please contact customer service to cancel the existing order and place a new 
                    one.

                <ul>

                    <li>- or any suspected fraudulent information</li>

                <strong>Errors, Inaccuracies, and Omissions</strong>
                <p>Occasionally, there may be information on our Websites and in Stores that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to product 
                    descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update 
                    information or cancel orders if any information on the Websites or in Stores is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted

                <strong>Reshipping of Merchandise</strong>
                <p>The Merchandise sold in our Stores and on our Websites is intended for personal use only, not for resale. Any suspected resale of our Merchandise for personal or 
                    business profit is strictly prohibited. We will not accept and reserve the right to cancel orders that appear to be for resale purposes. Any orders found to have 
                    characteristics of reselling, such as large quantities, frequent orders, orders by dealers or resellers or the use of freight forwarding, may be canceled in the sole 
                    discretion of L'Occitane, and L'Occitane shall have the right to Cancel all subsequent purchases from any such customers.For the purposes of this Agreement, 
                    reselling shall be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any Merchandise from L'Occitane for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of that same 
                    Merchandise with a third party.
                </p>
                <strong id="div3">Previous Fraudulent Order History</strong>
                <p>L'Occitane may refuse to accept any order for Merchandise if fraudulent activity is suspected and may refuse to process subsequent orders from customers with a 
                    previous fraudulent order history. We also may refuse any orders connected with a previous credit card dispute.
                </p>
                <p>If L'Occitane rejects your order because of an error in pricing or other information about the Merchandise, we will notify you at the email address you provided 
                    and ask you whether you would like to re-submit your order to purchase the relevant Merchandise once the Information in the order is validated. If we do not 
                    receive a response from you within seven days, L'Occitane may cancel the order.

                <h3>Pricing and Payment Policy</h3>
                <p>Pricing for Merchandise may be different on our Websites or from prices available in our stores or through our wholesale partners. Merchandise displayed on our

                <strong>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong>
                <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) grants you the right to request that we disclose to you, upon our receipt from 
                    you of a verifiable request, the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>(1) The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>
                    <li>(2) The categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected.</li>
                    <li>(3) The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal Information.</li>
                    <li>(4) The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li>
                    <li>(5) The specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We do not sell consumer Personal Information. We may from time to time disclose consumer Personal Information for a business purpose, such as operational 
                    purposes, or other notified purposes, that are reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purpose for which the Personal Information was 
                    collected or processed or otherwise is compatible with the context in which the Personal Information was collected.</p>
                <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose to you, upon our receipt from you of a verifiable request, the categories of Personal 
                    Information that we have disclosed about you for a business purpose.</p>
                <p>If you are a California resident, you also have the right under the CCPA to request the deletion of your Personal Information that we collect. All such requests are 
                    subject to verification according to methods determined by us. You may submit a request for the deletion of your Personal Information by sending an email to us.</p>
                <p>Even though we do not sell consumer Personal Information, if you are a California resident, you also have the right under the CCPA to opt-out of the sale of your 
                    Personal Information. All such requests are subject to verification according to methods determined by us. You may submit an opt-out request by sending an email 
                    to us or by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on the Website.</p>
                <p>Upon our receipt of a request by a California resident to exercise rights under the CCPA, we first must verify that the person making a request is the consumer 
                    about whom we have collected information. Accordingly, we will ask you to confirm your date of birth and postal address, and we also may request a copy of your 
                    valid government-issued identification.</p>
                <p>You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. However, nothing prohibits us from 
                    charging a consumer a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer, if that difference is reasonably 
                    related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data.</p>
                <p>You may exercise any of the California Privacy Rights described in this section by sending such a request to us by email. We may ask you to verify your identity 
                    before taking further action on your request. Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to 
                    designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, a copy of your valid government-issued identification 
                    and your authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification.</p>
                <p>Please note that we are not required to comply with a California resident’s request to delete Personal Information if it is necessary for us to maintain the Personal 
                    Information in order to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>(1) Complete the transaction for which the Personal Information was collected, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated 
                        within the context of our ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between us and the consumer.</li>
                    <li>(2) Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity.</li>
                    <li>(3) Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                    <li>(4) Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                    <li>(5) Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.</li>
                    <li>(6) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, 
                        when our deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if the consumer has provided informed 
                        consent.</li>
                    <li>(7) To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer's relationship with us.</li>
                    <li>(8) Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    <li>(9) Otherwise use the consumer's Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the 
                        information.</li>

                <h3>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h3>
                <strong>Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>
                <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, with the significant costs arising from legal disputes, not only in dollars but also in time and energy, both you 
                    and L’Occitane agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: In the event of any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any 
                    transaction conducted on the Websites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement or any part of it (“Dispute”), the party asserting 
                    the Dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts 
                    and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. 
                    Notices shall be sent</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. To L’Occitane at: L’Occitane Inc., Legal Department, 111 W 33rd St, 20th Floor New York, NY 10120, or </li>

                </ol>
                <p>Both you and L’Occitane agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any 
                    claim against the other party.</p>
                <strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>
                <p>To the extent you cannot resolve any Dispute through the informal dispute resolution procedure described above, a Dispute shall be resolved through binding 
                    individual arbitration (“Arbitration Agreement”). You agree to give up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights under this Agreement and with 
                    respect to any Dispute. You and L’Occitane expressly delegate to the arbitrator the authority to determine the arbitrability of any Dispute, including the scope, 
                    applicability, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration provision.</p>
                <p>You may begin an arbitration proceeding by sending a letter requesting arbitration to L’Occitane, Attn: Legal Dep’t, 111 W 33rd St, 20th Floor New York, NY 10120. 
                    You agree that the arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as 
                    modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available on the AAA’s website www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879. In the event the 
                    AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator 
                    fees will be governed by the AAA’s applicable rules. L’Occitane will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000. L’Occitane. waives its right to seek 
                    attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county 
                    where you live or at another mutually-agreed location.</p>
                <p>This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act. The terms of the 
                    Arbitration Agreement provisions shall survive after this Agreement terminates or your use of the Websites ends.</p>
                <p>In lieu of arbitration, either you or L’Occitane may bring any individual claim in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may 
                    apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim.</p>
                <strong>Waiver of Right to Bring Class Actions and Representative Claims </strong>
                <p>All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis, and not on a consolidated, representative or collective action basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve 
                    the Dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other customer. You and 
                    L’Occitane agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and 
                    L’Occitane hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration (either as a named-plaintiff or class 
                    member), and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If a court decides that applicable law 
                    precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must 
                    remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.</p>

                <h3>General</h3>
                <p>The foregoing Terms of Use govern all transactions between you and L’Occitane through our Websites and supersede all prior agreements and representations. 
                    Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define or limit the scope of the section. The failure of L’Occitane to act with respect to a breach of the 
                    Terms of Use by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit L’Occitane’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This 
                    Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflict of laws, except for the Arbitration Agreement above, 
                    which shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The waiver of any provision of the Agreement shall not be considered a waiver of any other provision or 
                    of L’Occitane’s right to require strict observance of each of the terms herein. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us relating to your use of 
                    the Websites.</p>
